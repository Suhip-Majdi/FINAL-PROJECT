# FINAL-PROJECT
The model was trained on a custom dataset collected using a high-resolution smartphone camera and augmented extensively to ensure generalization across varied conditions. Experimental results demonstrated strong detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.942 and a peak F1-score of 0.93, with particularly high accuracy for components such as crankshafts, batteries, and connecting rods. Real-world validation using webcam input confirmed the modelâ€™s robustness in workshop-like environments. This system represents a practical step toward the automation of garage diagnostics, robotics-based maintenance, and smart inventory management. Future work will focus on improving performance for underrepresented classes, deploying the system on embedded or edge devices, and exploring advanced model architectures such as transformer-based detectors or ensemble frameworks for further accuracy gains.
